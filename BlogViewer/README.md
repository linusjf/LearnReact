## Objective: Build an app that displays posts from a specified word press blog within a date range

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project.

01. User Story #1: I can see an input element with a corresponding id="wp-domain". This is the domain name of the wordpress blog to be entered by the user.

02. User Story #2: I can see two date picker elements with corresponding ids, "start-date" and "end-date". This will specify the range for which posts are to be retrieved.

03. User Story #3: I can see an element, with corresponding id "retrieve-posts" which on click will trigger the first load. If no posts exist for the range, an ekement with id "status" will display "No posts available!". If yes, it will display "1 of count".
