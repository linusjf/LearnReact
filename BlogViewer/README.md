# Build a Wordpress Blog Viewer

## Objective: Build an app that displays posts from a specified word press blog within a date range

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning frontend frameworks. Additional technologies not listed above are not recommended and using them is at your own risk. We are looking at supporting other frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue, but they are not currently supported. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

1. User Story #1: I can see an input element with a corresponding id="wp-domain". This is the domain name of the wordpress blog to be entered by the user.

2. User Story #2: I can see two date picker elements with corresponding ids, "start-date" and "end-date". This will specify the range for which posts are to be retrieved.

3. User Story #3: I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".

4. User Story #4: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".

5. User Story #5: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="author".

6. User Story #6: Within #quote-box, I can see four clickable elements or buttons with corresponding ids="first", "prev", "next" and "last".
